Background
========
Based on our observations, the majority of MIT students listen to music on their phones. In addition, most do so while traveling, bored, or waiting for something, a primary time when students are looking for other distractions on their phones. From previous experience, we know that MIT students are awkward. Even more are introverted, and find meeting new people difficult. Thatâ€™s why we aim to solve two problems at once with Spotispy, a mobile application that allows you to see what people around you are listening to. In addition, it can alert you when someone nearby is listening to identical music, a perfect opportunity to meet a new person with a common interest and find a concert buddy! We envision this application could be used for interesting information gathering, meeting new people, learning more about your existing friends and random MIT strangers, or discovering new music. By integrating with your existing phone music player, we hope this application will be non-intrusive and easy to use.
